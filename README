Create a Makefile-driven build environment for command-line WebOS developers.

This only works on Unix-like systems.  It has been tested on Linux, but might also work on MacOS, and on Windows with Cygwin installed.

(1) Install the WebOS SDK

(2) Create an empty directory, and "cd" into it in a terminal window.

(3) Execute the "webos-makemake" script in this directory
    ../path/to/webos-makemake com.mycompany.mydivision  helloworld  0.0.1
(changing appropriately)
